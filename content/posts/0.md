# GPT in Google Sheets

I often use ChatGPT and other LLMs for various project tasks. For one-off things I usually just use the normal chat interface
or various playground interfaces. I copy and paste things, it's not super organized but I'm often trying to get something
done so it doesn't have to be that organized.

The issue comes when I want to do something similar for more than just one thing. For example, classify 500 text files or whatever.
At that point I play around with the prompt, but I want to actually run the prompt for 500 times and keep the inputs and outpus
organized.

I looked into Simon W's LLM project, which is a command line utility for interacting with ChatGPT [project link](https://github.com/simonw/llm).
I sometimes prefer to use non-OpenAI models. I like [Together.AI](https://together.ai/), which doesn't seem to be supported at the moment.
The other aspect I didn't see how to do was template expansion in prompts with multiple variables and conditional formatting. I also didn't
see a way to do things with lists of inputs (from a CSV file or something).

I started playing with my own command-line tool. It's not done but gave me some intuition for how it should work. [GPTCommander](https://github.com/nwhitehead/gptcommander).

Then I had the idea of using Google Sheets or maybe Microsoft Excel. That is more "visual", easier to see what is really going on.

Some tools I looked at:

* GPT for Sheets and Docs: https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_and_docs/677318054654
* SheetAI: https://sheetai.app/
* Flowshot.ai: https://flowshot.ai/
* Excelformulabot: https://formulabot.com/

Pricing:
* GPT for Sheets and Docs: free in beta, will be 2x OpenAI API price with API key, 4x without key.
* SheetAI: free (5 formulas, 50 api calls), $8/month unlimited, own OpenAI API key (also $72/month, no extras for that???)
* Flowshot.ai: free demo, $9/month 3M chars, -> $379/month (unlimited), no OpenAI API keys ever

## Plan

My plan is to make a simple Google Sheets Add-On that can call ChatGPT and maybe some Together.AI models. I like the idea of using a cloud spreadsheet to keep
track of things. The Google documentation for this stuff is terrible, but after fiddling I managed to get the cat image demo working.

Docs:
* https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/cats-quickstart
* https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/guides/workspace-best-practices
* https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/how-tos/testing-workspace-addons

I'm thinking that the add-on is free by itself, has a button to extend functionality. Paste in your OpenAI API key. Extra paid functionality is things like extra
customized prompt functions, formula suggestion.
