# Static Blog

I'm trying out `hugo` for making blog posts. Seems to be working OK for now.

I thought about other options, like:
* Use a hosted blogging platform.
* Use `vitepress` or something similar related to `vue`.
* Use github pages and a git repo.

I like the idea of having a "real" website on my little `vultr` server. I get more control that way.
And with `hugo` I get nice markdown formatting. Deploying is pretty easy too.

## Theme

Right now I'm starting with the tutorial `ananke` theme.
